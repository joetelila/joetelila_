summary: " Highlights
• We propose a general data mining-based framework for mining real-time building electricity consumption data.
• The framework aims to identify typical electricity load patterns and discover insightful knowledge hidden in the patterns.
•Applications of the framework in three practical office buildings are presented.
•The framework is potentially used for an early fault detection of anomalous electricity load profiles."
