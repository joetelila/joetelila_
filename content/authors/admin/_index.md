I am a second year masters degree in computer science student at University of Pisa. I have experience in statistical programming, data processing, data visualization and applying predictive models. I have worked in educational institutions, start-ups and non-profit sectors. 

I recieved my bachelor's degree in computer science from Addis Ababa University in 2017. During the course of my academic and career I managed to work on projects that I have listed below, where I learned valuable skills such as time management, team collaboration and making critical decisions. Whether working on academic, extracurricular, or professional projects, I apply proven communication, leadership and teamwork skills.
